# Micro Frontend - Micro Frontend communication

In this example we have the following scenario:

- a Micro Frontend made with `React`;
- a Micro Frontend made with `Svelte`;

Our goal is to enable a bidirectional communication between them, using the `eventBus` in the Micro Frontends to share the counter value.

## Running example

import OrchyAdapter from '@site/src/components/OrchyAdapter';

<OrchyAdapter />
