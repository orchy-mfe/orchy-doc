# Use existing Single Page Applications


If you already have a Single Page Application, and you want to use it with `orchy`, here are described the steps to adapt it.

:::info
The following operations are already done if you decide to use one of ours [templates](../../templates/templates.md).
:::


## Bundler configuration

First of all, you **must** configure your bundler.

<Tabs groupId='bundler'>
<TabItem label="Vite" value="vite" default>

For [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you **must** install [`vite-plugin-qiankun`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-qiankun) and configure it as follows:

```javascript title="vite.config"
import qiankun from "vite-plugin-qiankun";

...
  plugins: [
    ...
    qiankun("REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MICROFRONTEND_ID", { useDevMode: true }),
    ...
  ]
...
```

:::warning
`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MICROFRONTEND_ID` **must** be replaced with the same value as [microPages.microFrontends.id](../../documentation/wc-configuration/microPages.md#micropagesmicrofrontendsid).
:::

Additionally, you **must** configure the [`base` shared option of Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#base).

```javascript
base: mode === "development" ? `http://localhost:${port}/` : "REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION",
```

Where:
- `port` is the port used by the development server;
- `REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION` **must** be replaced with the URL used to expose your static files.  
  Here you can also specify a different hostname, if you decide to host them in different CDNs.

:::note

Durint local development, you could have some problems related to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).  
To fix this, enable the right headers configuring the [server.cors property](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors).

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="webpack v4" value="webpack_v4">

For [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), we **must** configure three fields of the `output` object:

```javascript
const { name } = require('./package');

webpackConfig.output.library = `${name}-[name]`;
webpackConfig.output.libraryTarget = 'umd';
webpackConfig.output.globalObject = 'window';
```

:::note

To fix this, enable the right headers configuring the `headers` property.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, we **must** configure the entry file of your application:

<Tabs groupId='bundler'>
<TabItem label="Vite" value="vite" default>

Firstly, import the `vite-plugin-qiankun` helpers.

```javascript
import {renderWithQiankun, qiankunWindow} from 'vite-plugin-qiankun/dist/helper'
```

Next, edit the application bootstrap inserting the following boilerplate:

```javascript
renderWithQiankun({
  mount(props) {
    render(props)
  },
  bootstrap() {
  },
  unmount() {
  },
  update() {
  },
})

if (!qiankunWindow.__POWERED_BY_QIANKUN__) {
  render({})
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="webpack v4" value="webpack_v4">

Firstly, create a file called `public-path`, with this exact content:

```javascript title="public-path"
if (window.__POWERED_BY_QIANKUN__) {
    __webpack_public_path__ = window.__INJECTED_PUBLIC_PATH_BY_QIANKUN__
}
```

Secondly, you **must** import it:

:::danger

The `public-path` file **must** be the first `import` of your entry point.

:::

Finally, we **must** export three functions:

```javascript
export async function mount (props) {
  render(props)
}

export async function unmount (props) {
}

export async function bootstrap () {

}

if (!window.__POWERED_BY_QIANKUN__) {
  render({})
}
```
  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `render` function is the one that bootstraps your application.  
E.g., for `React` it should be something like:

```javascript
const render = (props = {}) => {
  const container = props.container ?? document
  root = createRoot(container.querySelector('#root'))
  root.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>
  )
}
```

# Conclusion

With this boilerplate, the application bootstrap is now *conditional*, because:
- if it is used as a standard SPA, it will be mounted as always did:
- if it is used in `orchy`, its lifecycle will be managed using [qiankun](https://qiankun.umijs.org/).

:::caution
You should always implement the `unmount` function, to avoid any kind of memory leak or undesired behavior.

Take a look at the [`React` template for an implementation example](https://github.com/orchy-mfe/orchy-react-js-typescript-template/blob/main/src/main.tsx).
