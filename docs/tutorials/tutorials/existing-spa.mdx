# Use existing Single Page Applications


If you already have a Single Page Application, and you want to use it with `orchy`, here are described the steps to adapt it.

:::tip
The following operations are already done if you decide to use one of our [templates](../../templates/templates.md).
:::


## Bundler configuration

First of all, you **must** configure your bundler.

<Tabs groupId='bundler'>
<TabItem label="Vite" value="vite" default>

For [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you **must** configure the [`base` shared option of Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#base).

```javascript
base: mode === "development" ? `http://localhost:${port}/` : "REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION",
```

Where:
- `port` is the port used by the development server;
- `REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION` **must** be replaced with the URL used to expose your static files.  
  Here you can also specify a different hostname, if you decide to host them in different CDNs.

:::note

Durint local development, you could have some problems related to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).  
To fix this, enable the right headers configuring the [server.cors property](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors).

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Webpack" value="webpack">

For [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), we **must** configure one field of the `output` object:

```javascript
webpackConfig.output.publicPath = mode === "development" ? `http://localhost:${port}/` : "REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION";
```

Where:
- `port` is the port used by the development server;
- `REPLACE_WITH_STATIC_FILES_POSITION` **must** be replaced with the URL used to expose your static files.  
  Here you can also specify a different hostname, if you decide to host them in different CDNs.

:::note

Durint local development, you could have some problems related to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).  
To fix this, enable the right headers configuring the [`headers` property](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverheaders).

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Entry file configuration

Firstly, install the `@orchy-mfe/spa-adapter` package:

```bash
npm i @orchy-mfe/spa-adapter
```

Then, we **must** edit the entry file of your application: it is usually named `main` or `index`.

Here we wrap the mount process of your application using the `OrchyMicroFrontend` class:

:::caution

This example works for React, but you can easily do the same thing for other frameworks/libraries.

:::

```javascript
import OrchyMicroFrontend from '@orchy-mfe/spa-adapter'
export class ReactMfe extends OrchyMicroFrontend {
  root
  async mount(orchyProps) {
    this.root = createRoot(this.getContainer())
    this.root.render(
      <StrictMode>
        <BrowserRouter basename={orchyProps?.baseUrl}>
          <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
      </StrictMode>
    )
  }

  async unmount(orchyProps) {
    this.root?.unmount()
  }
}

customElements.define('react-mfe', ReactMfe)
```

Here we are defining the `ReactMfe` class, and associating it to the `react-mfe` custom element tag, which is the one that will be configured in the [`micro-frontend` page configuration type](../../documentation/page-configuration/configuration-by-type#micro-frontend).

The `mount` method will bootstraps your application, while the `unmount` method will tear down it.
Under the hood, the `OrchyMicroFrontend` class will manage the most common part of the lifecycle for you.

## HTML file configuration

Now, we must change the `index.html` file that will be used to place our custom element inside the page:

```html
<body>
  <react-mfe></react-mfe>
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
</body>
```

## Conclusion

With this boilerplate, your application will be able to be booted both as `orchy` Micro Frontend and as standalone application.

:::note
You should always implement the `unmount` function, to avoid any kind of memory leak or undesired behavior.

Take a look at the [`React` template for an implementation example](https://github.com/orchy-mfe/orchy-react-js-typescript-template/blob/main/src/main.tsx).
